# Infrastructure Deployment for CQRS Pattern

This folder contains the **Bicep template** for deploying the required Azure resources for the **CQRS Pattern**. The resources include Azure App Service, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Cosmos DB for both Command and Query databases, and Azure Function Apps for the command handler, update processor, and query handler functions.

## ðŸ“‘ Files

- **`azure-resources.bicep`**: Bicep template file that defines all the necessary Azure resources.
- **`deploy-bicep.yml`**: GitHub Action workflow file to automate the deployment of the Azure infrastructure.

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy the Infrastructure

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Subscription**: You need an active Azure account.
2. **Azure CLI**: Installed and configured.
3. **GitHub Secrets Configuration**:
   - **`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`**: Azure service principal client ID.
   - **`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`**: Azure service principal client secret.
   - **`AZURE_TENANT_ID`**: Azure tenant ID.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Add Required Secrets to GitHub**:
   - Go to your repository's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret**.
   - Add the following secrets:
     - **`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`**: Your Azure service principal client ID.
     - **`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`**: Your Azure service principal client secret.
     - **`AZURE_TENANT_ID`**: Your Azure tenant ID.

2. **Run the GitHub Action**:
   - Push your changes to the `main` branch or manually trigger the **Deploy Azure Infrastructure with Bicep** workflow from the **Actions** tab.

3. **Monitor the Deployment**:
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Select the **Deploy Azure Infrastructure with Bicep** workflow to monitor the deployment progress.

### ðŸ“Š What Happens After Deployment

- The Bicep template will create the following resources:
  - **Azure App Service**: Hosts the API for handling command and query requests.
  - **Azure Event Hubs**: Serves as the event streaming platform for processing events.
  - **Azure Cosmos DB**: Used for both command (write) and query (read) operations.
  - **Azure Function Apps**: Hosts the Command Handler, Update Processor, and Query Handler Functions.
  - **Application Insights**: A monitoring tool that collects logs and telemetry data from all functions.

### ðŸ’¡ Next Steps

Once the infrastructure is deployed, proceed to deploy each of the Azure Functions (Command Handler, Update Processor, and Query Handler) and the App Service API using their respective GitHub Actions.
